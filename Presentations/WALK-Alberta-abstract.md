## Walking the WALK: Facilitating Interdisciplinary Web Archive Collaboration

The growth of digital sources since the advent of the World Wide Web in 
1991, and the commencement of widespread web archiving in 1996, presents 
profound new opportunities for social and cultural opportunities. In 
simple terms, we cannot study the 1990s without web archives: they are 
both primary sources that reflect how people consume and understand 
media, as well as repositories that document the thoughts, opinions, and 
activities of millions of everyday people. These are a dream for social 
historians. 

But wait, with all this opportunity comes challenges: large data, the 
need for interdisciplinary collaboration between historians who might 
have the questions but not the technical resources or knowledge to work 
with these sources, and basic questions around what a web archive is and 
how to access them. 

Libraries and archives are perfectly positioned to work in this new 
emerging field that brings together historians, computer scientists, and 
information specialists. In our talk, we discuss the fruits of one 
collaboration that has emerged at York University, the University of 
Alberta, and the University of Waterloo. Bringing together librarians, historians, and computer scientists, as well as an interdisciplinary team of undergraduate and graduate 
students, we are developing several web archival analytics projects. 

We work using a combination of 
centralized and de-centralized infrastructure to run data analytics, 
store web archives, provide a publicly-facing portal 
(<http://webarchives.ca/>), and collaborate using Slack. Weâ€™ll discuss the challenges of working in an 
interdisciplinary environment, and give insights into how the team has 
been working through in-detail case studies of our work with 
<http://webarchives.ca>, Twitter archiving and analysis, Compute Canada, and warcbase, a web analytics platform. The 
combination of computer scientists and humanists is not always a simple 
one, but it has proven to be worthwhile.
