#1. Get base addresses for each file.
#2. Initial comparison operations:
##  - for two or three collections, compare with venn diagram
##  - for three or more, use correspondence analysis to see which collections have
##    the most in common.
#3. Set AB = A %i% B; A = A - (A %i% B); B = B - (A %i% B) (for two comparison)
#4. Set ABC = A %i% B %i% C; AB = A %i% B - (ABC)  (etc.)
#5. Create table out of base addresses vs collections.
##  - decide if you want weighted programs. Does it make sense to include how frequently each site was crawled including # of pages?
##  - plot Chi-squared distance using mca library.
#6. Develop script to construct edgelist / graph.
#7. Save as graphml file for use in gephi.
